## From Week 1 of Effective Learning Techniques, these are some important applicable tips:

1. Different Modes of Thinking and their Importance

    There are different Modes of Thinking: Focused and Diffused modes, the focused mode is a mode of thinking is important mainly when you are focusing on a particular thing and trying to learn or understand it better, therefore, there is a limited part brain that can be accessed to contribute to your thought process, because you are focusing on a particular thing and not on many different or random things while, the Diffuse Mode is a more flexible mode of thinking when you are not focused on any particular thing, rather, you're just being chilled and letting your brain run some background threads, while you're doing another thing. There will be times when you will have to switch between focused and diffuse mode for somethings to workout the way you need it to.
    
2. Different Learning Techniques

    There are many ways to learn, but there are some that may be more effective for certain goals in learning and the specific to-be-learned material. One very effective technique I would personally use when learning about a new technology tool or programming language would definitely be practice testing and a mix of spaced-repetition. I would also largely depend on my previous knowledge from other programming experiences and exploring how those concepts are implemented in the new languages, doing more practices and testing yourself often.
